# Learning Unit on species Distribution Prediction


This repository provides some essintial geospatial open educational materials to teach students how to predict the distribution of different species agints the satelments. It uses Machine Learning (ML), more specifically random forest model, to predict the landcover of the target area from satelite images in order to specify the satelments. Then, the correaltion between the satelments and different species can be analyzed using additional species distibution data. As a use case, we use the fogo island as our targeted area. 

**Field:** Geospatial data analysis.

**Platforms:** QGIS and R Studio.

**Data:** Satalite images and tabular datasets.
