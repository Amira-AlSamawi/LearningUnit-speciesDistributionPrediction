# Mini-course on species Distribution Prediction


This repository provides some essential geospatial open educational materials to teach students how to predict the distribution of different species against the settlements. It uses Machine Learning (ML), more specifically a random forest model, to predict the landcover of the target area from satellite images in order to specify the settlements. Then, the correlation between the settlements and different species can be analyzed using additional species distribution data. As a use case, we use Fogo Island as our targeted area.
